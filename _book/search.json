    "text": "Abstract\nIn medieval bestiaries, there are two classes of evil represented by beasts; those which deceive and those which generate fear and death. Among the first class of beasts, those which are notable for their abilities to deceive, there are three kinds of deception: these are noted by the camouflages of the chameleon, accurate imitations of the manticore, and the “seductive skills of sirens”. While we might think this to be a medieval taxonomy of epistemic harms only, the kinds of epistemic harms the medievalists worried about are not far off from contemporary epistemic harms and risks; misinformation, false and inauthentic narratives, and bullshit.",

    "text": "Pinero\nPiñero Moral (2021) argues that this is because art’s purpose in the middle ages is to represent reality. It is one thing to accurately and factually represent a tree, however, Pinero is talking about more complex reality, especially moral reality. One example of medieval representations of moral reality include the Persian Manticore. The manticore as depicted in medieval art is said to represent evil.\nThere are several ways in which some art objects may represent more complex realities. One may think that the purpose of a painting is to reflect the experiences one had during a war, or peace time event. Such a painting may express the given facts of the case, for instance an artist could paint the signing of the Magna Carta. If the painting were painted by an artist who was alive to witness the signing of the Magna Carta, then the artist would merely be representing contemporary reality. If the art were not alive at the time, then we could argue that the artist is representing historical reality. If the artist is relying on trusted sources that are well-known, then this would be different than if the artist were imagining an event in which not many direct sources exist. But an artist can represent a projection of reality as well when the reality they want to convey is obscure, not well known, highly contested etc.\nBy definition, medieval art implies metaphysical aspirations and normative elements (Also see De Bruyne 1959). Its commitment with reality is undeniable yet the reality which it attempts to represent is so complex and vast that the limits between what is and what is not, between what we believe and what we know, between what we are and what we wish to be, are often blurred. (Cronin 1941)\nHere, the artist can represent facts as they believe them to be, or as they wish them to be. It is this latter motivation that Pinero suggests motivated medieval artwork representing the manticore. I will claim that there is a difference between modern and medieval artistic function. This in itself is uninteresting. However, what may be more interesting to the reader, is the further claim that this difference can be applied in response to the contemporary account of epistemic injustice.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hermeneutic Injustice\nFamously, Miranda Fricker develops an account of epistemic injustice that involves both testimony and hermeneutics. An important consideration here, is one’s capacity as a ‘moral’ knower where ‘moral’ knower has to do with a victim’s understanding of virtues, vices, and values that are attributed, or are not to the victim. Following (kupl20?), I argue that central to these are success or failure conditions whereby a person fails or succeeds in engaging in the imaginative ‘process of simulating’ a character’s psychological and emotional states [68]. However, while Kuplen argues the failure is due to our own imagination, I attribute it as a success condition in that these are ‘controlling images’ wherein the outcome is a form of narrative art which intends to portray characters whose mental states and experiences are the converse of that art’s audiences. I argue that this epistemic injustice makes individual who identify, or identified with such characters unintelligible to its audience.\nThe discussions that center around epistemic injustice focus on the moral wrongs of epistemic injustice and define these as wrongs of testimonial inference where the victim is wronged in their capacity as an epistemic knower. The victim’s credibility as an epistemic agent is diminished and as such, she is made unintelligible to a broader public. However, the wrongs do not draw enough attention to a specific kind of moral harm. Here, ‘moral’ implies ‘moral’ information, or ‘moral’ knowledge. Unlike general accounts of knowledge, moral knowledge has been understood as a kind of understanding. On the one hand, these are values that would have been instilled in the victim and that others would attribute to the victim as having. Such a harm I argue is two fold, as I will show. Not only are other prevented from understanding the victim, the victim is prevented from understanding herself. Both she and others are prevented from recognizing the victim’s moral agency.\nWhat is the difference between harm done in regard to someone’s capacity as a knower and their capacity as a ‘moral’ knower? Related to the victim’s capacity as a moral knower, is the victim’s capacity as a person, where personhood denotes more specifically, their own moral agency, held values, and the like.\nLet’s consider hermeneutic injustice.\nHermeneutic harm occurs when the victim suffers because they do not have the conceptual resources to make sense of their own experiences.\nBut here there are two possible concerns:\nFrom these are derived two more:\nAs an example of the first possible concern, a person is victimized by an agent who holds a degree of power over her when she cannot understand that she is a victim.\nWe can imagine that a given victim is a patriotic member of society who throughout the course of their life, has been led to believe that it is their duty and obligation to assist law enforcement in carrying out their duties whenever possible. One day they are walking to work when they notice a police officer chasing a suspect. The suspect runs past the victim, and when they do so, the victim trips the suspect. However here the victim is harmed in their capacity as a moral agent because they are prevented from carrying out what they take to be their moral duty, assisting law enforcement in carrying out their duties. This is because little do they know, the police officer chasing the suspect is actually working as an enforcer for the mob and the suspect is actually a whistle-blower trying to escape the clutches of the mob.\nTherefore, the victim is a victim just because they are prevented from doing what they intended to do, assist law enforcement in carrying out their duties. Here they are not assisting law enforcement, rather they are being victimized by a police officer working for the mob.\nHowever the harm is ambiguous. Either it is the case that in the event that this person does not recognize their own victimization, and believes themselves to be fulfilling their duty, or they are being prevented from fulfilling their duty without realizing it. Another question stemming from this is whether this person is in a position to defend their lack of protest.\nWe can imagine a situation wherein she is able to defend her decision not to protest, she might say “I am not a victim because it is the thought that counts”. In such a case, is she or is she not a victim? Derivative of this then, is the fact that she cannot express her moral values in a way that is interpretable to herself, or to others. For instance, the next day she recounts her story to a friend who convinces her of her victimhood. If they do convince her, is it from a position of power? Which structures, social or otherwise are responsible for this specific ability or inability?",

We can apply this to the case of the victim. The victim is not able to defend her belief that she is not a victim because her judgment of her friend as speaker hinders her ability to explain herself.

By using rap lyrics, Laybourn argues that we can compare oppressive othering with white standards of beauty. However, the way she does so is by drawing attention to a positive correlation between lighter skin tone and higher Billboard chart ratings.\nThere wasn’t a similar relation noticed between rap lyrics (oppressive othering) and higher chart ratings though at the center of the issue seems to be a suggestion that a harmful representation of blackness is sold to the public as “authentic blackness”. Importantly, this particular commodity then “shapes” what is accepted as authentic blackness, and what is commodified as authentic blackness.\nIn addition to the “oppressive othering” of cab, “white standards” of beauty are also sold. But it isn’t clear what correlation there is between cab and wsb if any. Laybourn argues that both wsb and cab stem from attitudes which position blacks as an outgroup and whites as an in-group. As such, when cabs are dangerous when they serve as an avenue for interaction with black culture and a proxy for interpersonal interaction with black Americans, even though they are created within a framework “that” reifies anti-blackness.\nOf deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images, consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations of themselves and of the communities in which they live. Therefore, there is a public perception that such images are not in themselves harmful. Therefore, there is strong disagreement regarding whether or not they are harmful (20C History Project 2014; Collins 2006, 2009; Sartwell 1998).\nLaybourn more narrowly defines cab as one dominant group’s creation of more inferior groups. This is accomplished through media portrayals linking anti-social behaviors, violence, abuse, crime, to these other groups."

    "text": "According to reductionism in personal identity, personal constitution, what defines the persistence of the human person over time, is reducible to psychological states being bound together. Causlism is the most popular account that explains the constitution of these psychological states. Accordingly to the causalist account, an object A at time T\\(_1\\) is identical to object B at time T\\(_2\\) as long as we can draw a continuous line from object A at time T\\(_1\\) to object B at time T\\(_2\\).\nNarrativists have argued that such accounts undermine our concepts of agency and moral responsibility, failing to explain attributions of praise or blame in response to an agent’s actions. This is because they offer no way to define the line as beginning at T\\(_1\\) and ending at T\\(_2\\). Christine (kors89?) proposes a practical conception of narrative identity. Accordingly, an agent is a person who uses narrative to define their own constitution. She calls this the self-constitution model of personal identity.",

As such, while the utilitarian asks ’what should be done for them?’, the Kantian asks ‘what ought they do?’.

    "text": "Introduction\nFollowing Goldie (2009)’s short paper Narrative Thinking, Emotion, and Planning, I consider the representation of emotional expressions of regret, narrative regret. I draw specific attention to the context of the representation of distinct special relationships in fiction. Important here are discourses on the fictional representation of such relationships as a special kind of human agency. I argue that a related concern are the assumptions about what is true and what is fiction in popular fiction.\n\n\nLaybourn\nResearch on black authenticity identifies “oppressive othering” and “white standards of beauty”, particularly lighter skin tone, as key components of commercial success in the entertainment industry.\n\nOppressive Othering (commodified black authenticity, cab)\nWhite Standards of Beauty (wsb)\n\nIn this note, I am only going to focus on oppressive othering / commodified black authenticity, cba.\nAre rap lyrics a case of oppressive othering? By using rap lyrics, Laybourn argues that we can compare oppressive othering with white standards of beauty. However, the way she does so is by drawing attention to a positive correlation between lighter skin tone and higher Billboard chart ratings.\nThere wasn’t a similar relation noticed between rap lyrics (oppressive othering) and higher chart ratings though at the center of the issue seems to be a suggestion that a harmful representation of blackness is sold to the public as “authentic blackness”. Importantly, this particular commodity then “shapes” what is accepted as authentic blackness, and what is commodified as authentic blackness.\nIn addition to the “oppressive othering” of cab, “white standards” of beauty are also sold. But it isn’t clear what correlation there is between cab and wsb if any. Laybourn argues that both wsb and cab stem from attitudes which position blacks as an outgroup and whites as an in-group. As such, when cabs are dangerous when they serve as an avenue for interaction with black culture and a proxy for interpersonal interaction with black Americans, even though they are created within a framework “that” reifies anti-blackness.\nOf deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images, consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations of themselves and of the communities in which they live. Therefore, there is a public perception that such images are not in themselves harmful. Therefore, there is strong disagreement regarding whether or not they are harmful (20C History Project 2014; Collins 2006, 2009; Sartwell 1998).\nLaybourn more narrowly defines cab as one dominant group’s creation of more inferior groups. This is accomplished through media portrayals linking anti-social behaviors, violence, abuse, crime, to these other groups."

    "text": "The Manticore\nThe Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.\nThe Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, a human-like face and the tail of a scorpion. Later writers would quote Ctesias’ description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king’s court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.\nOn some accounts, the manticore is a union between a hyena and Ethiopian lioness. It imitates the voices of men and possesses a fixed and immoveable gaze. In addition, it does not possess gums in either of its jaws, and rather than having multiple teeth, it has one large one.\nCtesias argued that the Manticore had a triple row of teeth which fit into each other like a comb, the face and ears of a human, blood colored eyes, the body of a lion and a stinging tail similar to a scorpion. While Pliny the elder argued that it imitated the voices of men, Ctesias tells us that its voice resembles a union of a flute and trumpet, that it is exceedingly swift, and has an appetite for human flesh [p. 280].\nAristotle questions Ctesias’ account, but nevertheless preserves it in his own writings. He gives Ctesias’ account, that the Manticore possesses a double row of teeth, similar feet and size of a lion, with ears and face like a man. Grey colored eyes and a red body, with a tail like that of a scorpion. [p. 30-31; also see Aristotle, History of Animals 8.28, 605b22-606a10]\nOwing to the fantastical nature of these accounts, it is highly probable that they are either misguided or motivated by some purposes other than truth. In the 57th question of the 1st of the second part of the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas defends the view of art as a form of right reason. There is a distinction here between the right reason for making objects, and the right reason for doing good actions. We should first focus on the point that is important to both of these activities, is the right use of one’s cognitive faculties. The difference lies in the produced object, whether an action or thing."

Doing so helps WR and PoWR understand and recognize the ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings.\nI think that the initial conclusion is a strong one.

Rather than WR and PoWR cultivating epistemic virtues, WR and PoWR should focus on the cultivation of epistemic virtues.

This point is probably more appropriate to ask of the broad literature and I am not sure that it has not been raised yet. However, if it has, then it seems that it would be an important point to include here. Following are a couple of reasons why I think this is true.\n\nAs I can tell, it is hard to understand why a racial or gendered minority may believe that a white samesex male couple ought to be considered marginalized in any context.\nE.g., we might think that a white heterosexual couple should be considered more marginzalized than the white male samesex couple.\n\nWhite men have more social mobility than white women.\nTherefore, two white men have more social mobility than one white man and one white woman while one white man and one white woman have more social mobility than two white women.\n\nOn the other hand, we might have reason to suspect that a white female samesex couple is considered more marginalized than the white heterosexual couple.\n\nThe second question is one of difference in kinds of harm. Is the kind of harm faced by racial, or ethnic minorities different from the kind faced by sexual preference? What about the kinds of harms faced by immigrant groups verses those faced by native born populations?"

    "text": "(book?){curr90, author = {Gregory Currie}, editor = {}, publisher = {Cambridge University Press}, title = {The Nature of Fiction}, year = {1990} }\nWhy do we think that fairy tales are fiction but news stories are not? Is fake news the same thing as a fairy tale? During the pandemic, fake news became a widely discussed talking point. A less widely discussed talking point however was why don’t we just call it fiction? A derivative of this question is how fiction is made possible. Meaning, what are the creative differences between fake news, news news and fairy tales? To answer this question, Gregory Currie suggests three possible answers.\nAccording to the front page news, the terrorist leader Amelia Boyd was killed by the Headhunters Gang. First are the characteristics that distinguish fiction from non-fiction. This question is a close investigation of the entities that are in fiction and make them possible. For instance, the psychological and linguistic resources that producers and consumers of fiction must have access to.\nFirst, consider that fiction uses language. But there is no universal linguistic feature shared by all fictional works and there is no available proof/s confirming what is a fiction.1 We usually think that reading a work is an act of reading words and sentences that make it up.2 However, consider a mime? Or silent films? These are works that do not use language in the traditional sense, yet we consider them fictional. Therefore, what makes something a fiction cannot necessarily be a linguistic feature. Therefore what makes something a fiction is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for being fictional. Finally then, something can be a fiction because of its verbal structure, but what makes it a fiction does not lie in the text itself.\n\n\nCurrie concludes that fictionality is a relational property, it is something possessed in virtue of the text’s relations to other things. Therefore while it is possible that fictionality is a linguistic matter, what makes it a fiction lies in some other property. (a method of communication, communicative practice)\nCurrie suggests that fictional properties, like non-fictional ones, have the semantic properties of truth value and reference. What this means is that a fictional statement can be true and false. For instance, consider the statement “Killing an NPC in monitored space will earn you a crime state”. According to Currie, this statement is true. What makes something true or false in a fiction, is its relation to the outside world. What is important however, is what this relationship is.\nReaders and Authors\nBecause fiction is a relational property, they are community based and “depend on the prevailing attitudes of the community, or of a subgroup of the community rather than the ideas of a single individual” (Currie 1990, 10). For I take it that an act of joint authorship is exactly that: an act engaged in by more than one person rather than several distinct acts undertaken individually and patched together. (Currie 1990, 11)\nThe process of creating a fiction begins with the intention. It is not a singular intention however, but is a social enterprise. So maybe the reason that we do not call fake news, fiction, is because of the purposes and intent of fake news. It is intended to deceive rather than express true propositions. But if this is true, then why do we not consider that fiction is intended to deceive? Why does fiction have semantic properties such as truth whereas fake news does not?

    "text": "The Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.\nOn some accounts, the manticore is a union between a hyena and Ethiopian lioness. It imitates the voices of men and possesses a fixed and immoveable gaze. In addition, it does not possess gums in either of its jaws, and rather than having multiple teeth, it has one large one.\nCtesias argued that the Manticore had a triple row of teeth which fit into each other like a comb, the face and ears of a human, blood colored eyes, the body of a lion and a stinging tail similar to a scorpion. While Pliny the elder argued that it imitated the voices of men, Ctesias tells us that its voice resembles a union of a flute and trumpet, that it is exceedingly swift, and has an appetite for human flesh [p. 280].\nAristotle questions Ctesias’ account, but nevertheless records it in his writings. He gives Ctesias’ account, that the Manticore possesses a double row of teeth, similar feet and size of a lion, with ears and face like a man. Grey colored eyes and a red body, with a tail like that of a scorpion. [p. 30-31; also see Aristotle, History of Animals 8.28, 605b22-606a10]\nOwing to the fantastical nature of these accounts, it is highly probable that they are either misguided or motivated by some purposes other than truth. In the 57th question of the 1st of the second part of the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas defends the view of art as a form of right reason. There is a distinction here between the right reason for making objects, and the right reason for doing good actions. We should first focus on the point that is important to both of these activities, is the right use of one’s cognitive faculties. The difference lies in the produced object, whether an action or thing.\nIf we are to ask ourselves what justifies our emotional responses to some given experience, on the one hand we might consider that the validity of the experience rests in something like the authenticity of the experience. Assuming that artistic experiences are driven by the same norms as other experiences, the image of the Manticore would generate fear in those who were lucky enough to witness an artistic representation of one, whether literary or visual.

It is this latter motivation that Pinero suggests motivated medieval artwork representing the manticore. I will claim that there is a difference between modern and medieval artistic function. This in itself is uninteresting. However, what may be more interesting to the reader, is the further claim that this difference can be applied in response to the contemporary account of epistemic injustice.\nWhy do we think that fairy tales are fiction but news stories are not? Is fake news the same thing as a fairy tale? During the pandemic, fake news became a widely discussed talking point. A less widely discussed talking point however was why don’t we just call it fiction? A derivative of this question is how fiction is made possible. Meaning, what are the creative differences between fake news, news news and fairy tales? To answer this question, Gregory Currie suggests three possible answers. According to the front page news, the terrorist leader Amelia Boyd was killed by the Headhunters Gang. First are the characteristics that distinguish fiction from non-fiction. This question is a close investigation of the entities that are in fiction and make them possible. For instance, the psychological and linguistic resources that producers and consumers of fiction must have access to.\nFiction and Language\nFirst, consider that fiction uses language. But there is no universal linguistic feature shared by all fictional works and there is no available proof/s confirming what is a fiction.1 We usually think that reading a work is an act of reading words and sentences that make it up.2 However, consider a mime? Or silent films? These are works that do not use language in the traditional sense, yet we consider them fictional. Therefore, what makes something a fiction cannot necessarily be a linguistic feature. Therefore what makes something a fiction is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for being fictional. Finally then, something can be a fiction because of its verbal structure, but what makes it a fiction does not lie in the text itself.\nSemantic Properties\nCurrie concludes that fictionality is a relational property, it is something possessed in virtue of the text’s relations to other things. Therefore while it is possible that fictionality is a linguistic matter, what makes it a fiction lies in some other property. (a method of communication, communicative practice)\nCurrie suggests that fictional properties, like non-fictional ones, have the semantic properties of truth value and reference. What this means is that a fictional statement can be true and false. For instance, consider the statement “Killing an NPC in monitored space will earn you a crime state”. According to Currie, this statement is true. What makes something true or false in a fiction, is its relation to the outside world. What is important however, is what this relationship is.\nReaders and Authors\nBecause fiction is a relational property, they are community based and “depend on the prevailing attitudes of the community, or of a subgroup of the community rather than the ideas of a single individual” (Currie 1990, 10). For I take it that an act of joint authorship is exactly that: an act engaged in by more than one person rather than several distinct acts undertaken individually and patched together. (Currie 1990, 11)\nThe process of creating a fiction begins with the intention. It is not a singular intention however, but is a social enterprise. So maybe the reason that we do not call fake news, fiction, is because of the purposes and intent of fake news. It is intended to deceive rather than express true propositions. But if this is true, then why do we not consider that fiction is intended to deceive? Why does fiction have semantic properties such as truth whereas fake news does not?\nWe might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by Jonathan Gilmore (2020), art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption (Gilmore 2020, 132). Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodoxical ends intending to motivate desirable behaviors and behavioral responses. On one account of this deception, a person holds false beliefs about themselves. These beliefs stem from hermeneutically unjust environments where the individual lacks access to resources that would lead to accurate self-understanding and moral beliefs. Such beliefs are rooted in irrational actions performed by the individual.\nIt does this by contrasting the concept of hermeneutic justice as popularized by Miranda Fricker (2007) but developed by earlier feminists. We might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by Jonathan Gilmore (2020), art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption (Gilmore 2020, 132). Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodoxical ends intending to motivate behaviors and behavioral responses. As an artistic object, the Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.\nThe Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, a human-like face and the tail of a scorpion. Later writers would quote Ctesias’ description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king’s court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.\nIn the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas defends the view of art as a form of right reason [I-II, Q.57]. There is a distinction here between the right reason for making objects, and the right reason for doing good actions. But a better analogy here is ‘making actions with good outcomes’. We should first focus on the point that is important to both of these activities, is the right use of one’s cognitive faculties.\nThe difference lies in the produced object, whether an action or thing. But here, we should pause momentarily or we risk conflating two senses of right action. In the ancient context, right action would more probably be used to reference actions that align with a dominant organizational structure, for instance the Catholic church. In our own modern context, we are less apt to recognize a singular dominant moral authority. This presents a problem since we would want to say something more akin to ‘beneficial’, or ‘productive’ action where ‘benefit’ and ‘product’ are more expressive of individual tastes and desires.\nConsidering a product that is produced, the desired outcome of the activity of art, it is not clear what it is exactly, that we collectively care about in the case of art then. When it comes to what is produced by artistic endeavor, it is not clear whether a normative account should include a material commodity, or a desired outcome apart from a material commodity. When we think about what a good artistic endeavor entails, in the modern conception, there is typically some monetary component. For instance, an admirable artistic endeavor at the center of an advertising campaign would ideally result in increased revenue for the advertising clients and increased business for the advertiser.\nHowever, the medieval conception of an admirable artistic endeavor consists of outcomes which invoke some kind of behavior. Whether dispositions or actions, ultimately there is a desire for an intended outcome as it correlates specifically with a human actor. Harrison (2011) argues for instance, that Elizabeth Gaskell’s novel Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life was in part responsible for the UK’s expanded social safety net. Gaskell represented the suffering and distress experienced by the working poor in a way that allowed her upper-class Victorian audience to empathize with the lower social classes (Harrison 2011, 258). For instance, we might think that a good artist produces items of great monetary value. But using the medieval depiction as expressed above, it seems that a good artist instead motivates an actor to behave in a way that produces good outcomes. The common contemporary understanding considers various perspectives. However, it is important to understand the two important points here.\nPiñero Moral (2021) argues that this is because art’s purpose in the middle ages is to represent reality. It is one thing to accurately and factually represent a tree, however, Pinero is talking about more complex reality, especially moral reality. One example of medieval representations of moral reality include the Persian Manticore.\nThe manticore as depicted in medieval art is said to represent evil. There are several ways in which some art objects may represent more complex realities. One may think that the purpose of a painting is to reflect the experiences one had during a war, or peace time event. Such a painting may express the given facts of the case, for instance an artist could paint the signing of the Magna Carta. If the painting were painted by an artist who was alive to witness the signing of the Magna Carta, then the artist would merely be representing contemporary reality. If the art were not alive at the time, then we could argue that the artist is representing historical reality. If the artist is relying on trusted sources that are well-known, then this would be different than if the artist were imagining an event in which not many direct sources exist.\nBut an artist can represent a projection of reality as well when the reality they want to convey is obscure, not well known, highly contested etc. By definition, medieval art implies metaphysical aspirations and normative elements (De Bruyne 1959). Its commitment with reality is undeniable yet the reality which it attempts to represent is so complex and vast that the limits between what is and what is not, between what we believe and what we know, between what we are and what we wish to be, are often blurred. (Cronin 1941) Here, the artist can represent facts as they believe them to be, or as they wish them to be. It is this latter motivation that Pinero suggests motivated medieval artwork representing the manticore.\nThere is a distinctive kind of epistemic harm/injustice that consists of undermining our ability to convey knowledge to others and make sense of our own experiences (Fricker 2007). Wendy Laybourn (2018) proposes a criticism of black authenticity and what she calls commodified realness. According to Laybourn, identity is sold to a broader public as black authenticity. This criticism is centered around the effects of what she calls controlling images in popular media. Of deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations and not in themselves harmful. Yet too, this is also a common trope, as old as society.\nI present this case as an example of a paradigmatic concept of hermeneutic injustice. It is not clear just what aspects of the member’s lives are represented, nor specifically which images are harmful if such images are accepted as representative. An important question here has to do with the relationship between popular narratives that contain these images, and personal identity. One approach argues that we are defined by the stories we accept about ourselves, but this is controversial.\nIt is not necessarily clear where to find the literature on specifically what is at issue here. Because of this, I think it will be helpful to start with something of an analogy, specifically one from the popular narrative. In the newest Wicked screen adaptation, there is an underlying story line. The protagonist, the ‘wicked’ witch finally comes to accept that she will never be accepted by the broader public and as such, will always stand out as a scapegoat of sorts owing to her dark green skin. Therefore she fully leans into her ‘wicked’ persona.\nHowever, perhaps a detail which could not be included as prominently in Gregory Maguires 1995 novel. The amazing actress, Cynthia Erivo, is an African American with especially prominent features, accentuated owing to the excellent applied makeup and superb acting by Evrivo. Through both movies, it is obvious that she isn’t green in reality, but African American. We see the story of the witch as a case of othering. As such, especially poignant was the moment when Dorothy, believing the witch can be killed throws a bucket of water on her, an old racist trope about African Americans and bathing.\nIt is a fortunate accident I suppose, director John M. Chu taking perfect advantage of the fact that the witch in the original dies having had a bucket of water thrown onto her. The witch, fully adopting her role, seemingly for the good of the people of Oz, ‘dies’, but in the fiction, merely goes into hiding. Ultimately Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, turned Straw man, strike out to the desert after her sacrificial death accepting that they will forever be scapegoats should they choose to stay in Oz.\nI highlighted some concerns raised by Laybourn (2018) regarding representation and authenticity. Here, I want to draw attention to some additional similar concerns. I then raise my own concerns, I specify that these criticisms unfairly focus too narrowly on the black experience and do not do a good enough job in recognizing that these experiences are universal. Given their universality, I argue that a best response is found in a Christian theodicy to evil. I draw on the psychological literature of in-group and out-group behavior. Wendy Laybourn (2018) proposes a criticism of black authenticity and what she calls commodified realness. According to Laybourn, identity is sold to a broader public as black authenticity. This criticism is centered around the effects of what she calls controlling images in popular media. Of deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations and not in themselves harmful. Yet too, this is also a common trope, as old as society.\nSome similar examples of this criticism can be found in Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020) or Mbembe (2017)’s Critque of Black Reason. Jackson (2020) defends the view of race as a social construct. Here black represents a void of reason and a surplus of animality. It is not clear what the counter to this claim should be as it is not represented anywhere in either work. However, looking at what is deemed black culture broadly in popular media, this counter claim is even more difficult to understand given that many African Americans fail to explicitly and publicly criticize, or at the very least, argue that such behaviors are not culturally representative. Popular artists who reflect similar characteristics as those deemed synonymous to the black race are praised and vaunted. Black female artists for instance, who reinforce stereotypes of blacks as hypersexualized, vulgar, using codes such as twerking to exemplify their over hyper-sexualized nature, are praised as empowering or authentic, where as black male artists are praised as being “real” or “gritty” for expression unjustified violence directed at other blacks. But this is just to mimic the age old racist justifications for slavery although slavery, in name, has been outlawed. According to this justification, blackness represents a blurred distinction between human and animal.\nMan distinguishes himself from animality, but this is not the case for the Black Man, who maintains within himself, albeit with a certain degree of ambiguity, animal possibility. A foreign body in our world, he is inhabited­under cover—by the animal. To debate Black reason is therefore to return to the collection of debates regarding the rules of how to define the Black Man: how he is recognized, how one identifies the animal spirit that possesses him, ­under which conditions the ratio penetrates and governs the animalitas. (Mbembe 2017, 56)\nA very famous example of just such an exchange occurred between the Reverend Calvin Butts who highlights serious objects to black representation in gangster rap, and the artist known as Ice T (20C History Project 2014) who gave voice to an entire generation who completely misses the point. The question that remains is what the justifications of such representations are useful for now since slavery has been outlawed? What is less clear, is what to make of those African Americans who praise artists such as Tupac, Lizzo, Cardi B., Megan Thee Stallion. Like Ice T, they represent a view that has not grasped the similarity between using notions of black animality to justify, for instance, taking children away from their parents to sell to a sugar plantation. The question here is what artist representations of black animality now justify?\nMiranda Fricker (2007) argues that social power is a socially situated capacity to control another’s actions (Fricker 2007, 9–13). The teacher’s ability is a social power rooted in the collective imagination of a community. Through her grading of her student’s work, a teacher is able to influence whether or not a student uses capital letters at the start of a sentence. Sometimes this social power is exercised in a way to create prejudicial stereotypes. A prejudicial stereotype is a kind image about what attributes belong to which social groups. The stereotype distorts a hearer’s ability to apply the apt credibility judgments in a given domain, such as testimony. Some groups are unfairly benefited from the exercise of this power while other groups are unfairly penalized.\nA virtuous hearer is one who reliably corrects for the influence of prejudice in her credibility judgments. Perhaps she is able to recognize when her judgments are not apt, and is able to recognize that they are not apt because of the prejudice that she holds. Therefore, virtuous testimonial injustice corrects for the influence of identity prejudice. Power is a social capacity/agency. It is a kind of agency that fortifies the ability of its host to influence what happens in the world. There are two ways to exercise this agency, human or structural. We can imagine a person who is able to convince a jury that a crime occurred. But the human capacity is dependent on a structure that enables the human to articulate his argument in a way that does not distort it. It depends on an educational history. Therefore human agency is in many ways also structural. So structural agency is merely structural human agency.\nAdditionally, the kinds of events that we care most about, are those that occur in the social realm and there are two ways to make these kinds of events occur, through active human agency, or passive structural agency. Therefore power, human or structural, is social power and its agents are social agents and the hosts of social power are social agents. But who are these agents? Those who are agents are those for whom society imagines to be endowed with a special kind of agency. For instance, a police officer is a person whom society imagines to be endowed with a characteristic social power. This power comes from an additional imagination such that that individual who is a police officer, is somehow deserving of this power.\nIn the social imagination, this person possesses enough self-control such that they are allowed to carry firearms, unlike convicted felons. Therefore the central cases of testimonial injustice is prejudicial and consists in credibility excesses and deficits where we give more credibility to some identities and less to others. Fricker argues in the second chapter that prejudice is made possible through stereotypes (For instance, see Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982). These stereotypes persist through the social imagination, but more importantly, there is a question about their source. A form of agency then involves the ability of an individual or group of individuals to infuse the social imagination with stereotypes.\nSusan Pepper-Gates writes a very engaging and important paper applying Miranda Fricker (2007)’s analysis of epistemic injustice to contemporary Western Religion WR, and the Philosophy of Religion, PoWR. She argues that the philosophy of religion should cultivate epistemic-ethical virtues in order to recognize and include philosophers from minority voices. Doing so helps WR and PoWR understand and recognize the ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings. I think that the initial conclusion is a strong one. Namely the ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings. However, I think that the most important conclusion here is a premise conclusion statement, rather than just a conclusion. Rather than WR and PoWR cultivating epistemic virtues, WR and PoWR should focus on the cultivation of epistemic virtues. This will give the project of WR and PoWR two convergent aims.\nFirst, it would be to draw attention to the ways in which power can shape our lives as embodied social beings. Cultivating virtue in this context then means that WR and PoWR ought to be formative, cultivating virtue in their audiences. This virtue in turn makes it less likely that power will shape the lives of members of WR and PoWR’s audiences. First, consider 1: In cases of marginal representation, it is not clear just what aspects of the member’s lives are represented, nor specifically which images are harmful if such images are accepted as representative. An important question here has to do with the relationship between popular narratives that contain these images, and personal identity. One approach argues that we are defined by the stories we accept about ourselves, but this is controversial.\nIt is not necessarily clear where to find the literature on specifically what is at issue here. Because of this, I think it will be helpful to start with something of an analogy, specifically one from the popular narrative. In the newest Wicked screen adaptation, there is an underlying story line. The protagonist, the ‘wicked’ witch finally comes to accept that she will never be accepted by the broader public and as such, will always stand out as a scapegoat of sorts owing to her dark green skin.

Ultimately Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, turned Straw man, strike out to the desert after her sacrificial death accepting that they will forever be scapegoats should they choose to stay in Oz.\nFinally, though I will not have space to argue this here, I would add that versions of WR and PoWR have already historically done this.\nSome Questions\nI have some initial questions which I will articulate first here: What harms are suffered by which groups? This point is probably more appropriate to ask of the broad literature and I am not sure that it has not been raised yet. However, if it has, then it seems that it would be an important point to include here. Following are a couple of reasons why I think this is true.\nAs I can tell, it is hard to understand why a racial or gendered minority may believe that a white samesex male couple ought to be considered marginalized in any context. E.g., we might think that a white heterosexual couple should be considered more marginzalized than the white male samesex couple.\nWhite men have more social mobility than white women.\nTherefore, two white men have more social mobility than one white man and one white woman while one white man and one white woman have more social mobility than two white women. On the other hand, we might have reason to suspect that a white female samesex couple is considered more marginalized than the white heterosexual couple. The second question is one of difference in kinds of harm. Is the kind of harm faced by racial, or ethnic minorities different from the kind faced by sexual preference? What about the kinds of harms faced by immigrant groups verses those faced by native born populations?\nPeppers-Gates Analysis of Fricker\nWestern Religion, WR, and The Philosophy of Western Religion, PoWR, ignore work by intersectional feminist philosophers and philosophers of race who challenge the traditional approach, Traditional epistmology, TE, focuses on abstract universal knowledge. Philosophy of religion grounds itself in TE and focuses on rational belief The philosophy of religion should cultivate epistemic-ethical virtues in order to recognize and include philosopers from minority voices.\nSome initial confusions:\nWhat harms are suffered by which groups?\nA white samesex male couple may not be considered marginalized in any context. E.g., white heterosexual couple should be considered more marginzalized than the white male samesex couple while the white female samesex couple is considered more marginalized than the white heterosexual couple. White men have more social mobility than white women. Two white men have more social mobility than one white man. Therefore, two white men have more social mobility than one white man and one white woman while one white man and one white woman have more social mobility than two white women.\nThe kind of harm faced by racial, or ethnic minorities is different from the kind faced by sexual preference. WR and PoWR ignore work by intersectional feminist philosophers and philosophers of race who challenge the traditional approach,\nTraditional epistemology focuses on abstract universal knowledge.\nPhilosophy of religion grounds itself in traditional epistemology and focuses on rational belief\nTherefore WR and PoWR embrace narrow methodologies that exclude others and contribute to the marginalization of minority voices.\nTherefore WR and PoWR conflate the truth about the existence and attributes of a [patriarchal] God with traditional epistemic approaches grounded in [narrow methodological approaches to knowledge]. By focusing on narrow methodologies and abstract conceptions of knowledge, WR and PoWR fail to consider ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings. WR and PoWR have silenced marginalized groups. These include women, people of color, disabled persons and LGBTQI community members [if these voices are marginalized, how can they be considered community members?]. This is because traditional epistemology, TE, focuses on abstract conceptions of knowledge and thereby fails to consider the ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings [Using the grammar contrast, we assume that a person can learn grammar and we exclude them from the larger conversation until they do. Do we not think that a person can learn how to operate within the rules invoked under ‘abstract conceptions of knowledge’?]. TE focuses on abstract conceptions of knowledge and thereby fails to consider the ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings [Using the grammar contrast, we assume that a person can learn grammar and we exclude them from the larger conversation until they do. Do we not think that a person can learn how to operate within the rules invoked under ‘abstract conceptions of knowledge’?]. WR and PoWR have silenced marginal groups [calling groups marginal seems to marginalize them]. TE focuses on abstract conceptions of knowledge and therefore fails to consider ways power shapes our lives as social beings. PoR grounds itself in TE by focusing on ‘rational’ belief in its debates about God’s existence and attributes. Therefore PoR ignores feminist philosophers and philosophers of race who challenge PoR grounds in TE (fp and por then reject ‘rational’ belief?). PoR’s embrace of its narrow methodology and range of topics is based on an exclusion of ‘others’ from meaning making in institutional philosophy. My contribution: The Philosophy of religion focuses on rational belief and conflates this in its debates about existence and attributes of a patriarchal God. Silencing Western religion and philosophy of religion have silenced marginalized groups by focusing on abstract conceptions of knowledge which fails to consider ways that power shapes our lives as embodied social beings. Traditional epistemology focuses on abstract conceptions of knowledge. These are inadequate because they do not analyze the ways power shapes our lives as “embodied social beings”. We are born in webs of meaning and social relations of [power and privilege (are journal review practices an exercise of power and privilege?)]. Some voices are heard [pass review], meaning that they shape the social imagination (define social imagination) and others are ignored [do not pass review and therefore . . .]. They are incapable of shaping the social imagination. However, how is this done? One way is through the enforcement of so-called grammar rules. Taking an art class, he attempted to communicate the rules which apply to a given art genre. However, the students noted the many deviations from these rules. The teacher replied by saying that “once you know how to apply the rules, then you are allowed to break the rules”. An imagined analogy would be a reviewer rejecting a paper for the alleged abuse of grammar rules, syntax, and not content, truth value, where the so-called rules are applied as a means of gatekeeping who gets to shape the ‘social-imagination’. A student who fails to learn the rules, is not accepted into the art community, their work is posted in galleries, sold at auctions, is not publicly (positive or negative) reviewed. This excludes people from shared social understanding, contributing to the harm of that individual, can be used as a weapon that harms. What is this weapon and how specifically does it harm? Participation in shared conceptual structure is a marker of humanity. Therefore gatekeepers undermine the process by which a person becomes human. Better, is to say they undermine the process by which a person is considered human. Hermeneutic Injustice When DSS (Dominant Social Structure) of meaning excludes you or distorts your experiences, and no social concepts that you recognize capture your vision of yourself, then your capacity as a knower and your own self-understanding have been stunted. But this introduces a very narrow vision of social structure. Isn’t it possible that while you are excluded from a dss, a non-dss, one that includes you and does not distort your experiences, could still capture a vision of yourself, and your capacity as a knower and fortifying your self-understanding. What is needed then is a new non-dss, education. While a person is excluded from a dss, they could have their capacity as a knower fortified by a non-dss, education reimagined. The need to reimagine education. WR and PoR become DSS’s of meaning and exclude some or distort their experiences But this introduces a very narrow vision of social structure. It is possible that while you are excluded from a dss, a non-dss, one that includes you and does not distort your experiences, could still capture a vision of yourself, and your capacity as a knower and fortifying your self-understanding. So while a person is excluded from a dss, they could have their capacity as a knower fortified by a non-dss. Therefore 2 this does not mean that there are no social concepts that you recognize and capture your vision of yourself and your capacity as a knower and your own self-understanding are stunted but not by the DSS, but the lack of the non-dss. One Possible example of hermeneutic injustice against religious minorities Secular community marginalization against people of religious faith. PoRF may lack ’sensibilities and resources needed to make sense of religious people’s experiences,” (Kidd, 20217). But does not capture the gravity of systemic cases of hermeneutical injustice whose targets experience multiple forms of injustice. Hermeneutical marginalization “entails marginalization of a socioeconomic sort’, targets will not ’participate on equal terms within the practices of law, academia, politics, religion, journalism, media, etc. (Fricker, 2010). However, DSS vs. non-DSS? While DSS of meaning may distort experiences, non-dss may not, instead rejecting dss of meaning which says that “there are no social concepts which capture a religious person’s vision of themselves (i.e., made in image of God, human dignity bestowed by God, not DSS, etc.)”. Consider the following claims: Here, Fricker, a published philosopher, the DSS, says persons of a certain sort are marginalized and therefore have been silenced. But here, marginalization means they lack a marker of humanity. As such, Fricker claims that certain individuals lack a marker of humanity. Why? For not adhering to rules of rationality practiced by the dss. Surely they could however do so? Because of 1, they lack participation in shared meaning. Therefore lack capacity as knowers. From 3, their self-understanding is mitigated and stunted. Participation in shared hermeneutic, i.e., 1-4, in shared conceptual structure is a marker of humanity”, Therefore, because of exclusion from shared conceptual structure, they lack a marker of humanity. but rather than ‘victims’ being excluded from shared conceptual structure and lacking capacity as knowers and lacking marker of humanity, they instead are included in different conceptual structure (e.g., religious conceptual structure) which fortifies their capacity as knowers and self-understanding, acting as marker of humanity.\nReferences Fricker, Miranda. 2007.

In order for a trait to be the virtue of a human being, some would like to say that it has to represent choices, rationality, actions, beliefs. However, often times these depend on environmental variables which we do not control. Most importantly among these are the values that we hold dear to us. Whether or not we recognize the importance of close relationships for instance. However, if the luck question is accurate, even these values depend on factors that are outside of our control. Our fragility, need for loved ones, friendship, etc., can at one time depend on whether or not we’ve encountered sufficient hardships for instance, but even outside the experience of hardships, friendships, which are also external and an environmental variable at once hold intrinsic importance, although these are external to us. As such “human goodness is nourished, even constituted, by external happenings”. [1-2]"

    "text": "The Manticore in Medieval Art\nWe might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by Gilmore (2020), art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption [132]. Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodox ends intending to motivate desirable behaviors and behavioral responses. On one account of this deception, a person holds false beliefs about themselves. These beliefs stem from hermeneutically unjust environments where the individual lacks access to resources that would lead to accurate self-understanding and moral beliefs. Such beliefs are rooted in irrational actions performed by the individual.\nIt does this by contrasting the concept of hermeneutic justice as popularized by Miranda Fricker (2007) but developed by earlier feminists. We might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by Jonathan Gilmore (2020), art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption (Gilmore 2020, 132). Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodoxical ends intending to motivate behaviors and behavioral responses. As an artistic object, the Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.\nThe Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, a human-like face and the tail of a scorpion. Later writers would quote Ctesias’ description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king’s court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.\n\n\n\n\nGilmore, Jonathan. 2020.

    "text": "Wendy Laybourn’s Cost of Being Real\nPiñero Moral (2021) argues that this is because art’s purpose in the middle ages is to represent reality. It is one thing to accurately and factually represent a tree, however, Pinero is talking about more complex reality, especially moral reality. One example of medieval representations of moral reality include the Persian Manticore. The manticore as depicted in medieval art is said to represent evil.\nThere are several ways in which some art objects may represent more complex realities. One may think that the purpose of a painting is to reflect the experiences one had during a war, or peace time event. Such a painting may express the given facts of the case, for instance an artist could paint the signing of the Magna Carta. If the painting were painted by an artist who was alive to witness the signing of the Magna Carta, then the artist would merely be representing contemporary reality. If the art were not alive at the time, then we could argue that the artist is representing historical reality. If the artist is relying on trusted sources that are well-known, then this would be different than if the artist were imagining an event in which not many direct sources exist. But an artist can represent a projection of reality as well when the reality they want to convey is obscure, not well known, highly contested etc.\nBy definition, medieval art implies metaphysical aspirations and normative elements (Also see De Bruyne 1959). Its commitment with reality is undeniable yet the reality which it attempts to represent is so complex and vast that the limits between what is and what is not, between what we believe and what we know, between what we are and what we wish to be, are often blurred. (Cronin 1941)\nHere, the artist can represent facts as they believe them to be, or as they wish them to be. It is this latter motivation that Pinero suggests motivated medieval artwork representing the manticore. I will claim that there is a difference between modern and medieval artistic function. This in itself is uninteresting. However, what may be more interesting to the reader, is the further claim that this difference can be applied in response to the contemporary account of epistemic injustice.\nResearch on black authenticity identifies “oppressive othering” and “white standards of beauty”, particularly lighter skin tone, as key components of commercial success in the entertainment industry.\nIn this note, I am only going to focus on oppressive othering / commodified black authenticity, cba.\nAre rap lyrics a case of oppressive othering? By using rap lyrics, Laybourn argues that we can compare oppressive othering with white standards of beauty. However, the way she does so is by drawing attention to a positive correlation between lighter skin tone and higher Billboard chart ratings.\nThere wasn’t a similar relation noticed between rap lyrics (oppressive othering) and higher chart ratings though at the center of the issue seems to be a suggestion that a harmful representation of blackness is sold to the public as “authentic blackness”. Importantly, this particular commodity then “shapes” what is accepted as authentic blackness, and what is commodified as authentic blackness.\nIn addition to the “oppressive othering” of cab, “white standards” of beauty are also sold. But it isn’t clear what correlation there is between cab and wsb if any. Laybourn argues that both wsb and cab stem from attitudes which position blacks as an outgroup and whites as an in-group. As such, when cabs are dangerous when they serve as an avenue for interaction with black culture and a proxy for interpersonal interaction with black Americans, even though they are created within a framework “that” reifies anti-blackness.\nOf deep concern here, is that many of the members of the communities depicted by such images, consider aspects of these images to be authentic representations of themselves and of the communities in which they live. Therefore, there is a public perception that such images are not in themselves harmful. Therefore, there is strong disagreement regarding whether or not they are harmful (20C History Project 2014; Collins 2006, 2009; Sartwell 1998).\nLaybourn more narrowly defines cab as one dominant group’s creation of more inferior groups. This is accomplished through media portrayals linking anti-social behaviors, violence, abuse, crime, to these other groups.",

    "text": "Semantic Properties\nCurrie concludes that fictionality is a relational property, it is something possessed in virtue of the text’s relations to other things. Therefore while it is possible that fictionality is a linguistic matter, what makes it a fiction lies in some other property. (a method of communication, communicative practice)\nCurrie suggests that fictional properties, like non-fictional ones, have the semantic properties of truth value and reference. What this means is that a fictional statement can be true and false. For instance, consider the statement “Killing an NPC in monitored space will earn you a crime state”. According to Currie, this statement is true. What makes something true or false in a fiction, is its relation to the outside world. What is important however, is what this relationship is.\nReaders and Authors\nBecause fiction is a relational property, they are community based and “depend on the prevailing attitudes of the community, or of a subgroup of the community rather than the ideas of a single individual” (Currie 1990, 10). For I take it that an act of joint authorship is exactly that: an act engaged in by more than one person rather than several distinct acts undertaken individually and patched together. (Currie 1990, 11)\nThe process of creating a fiction begins with the intention. It is not a singular intention however, but is a social enterprise. So maybe the reason that we do not call fake news, fiction, is because of the purposes and intent of fake news. It is intended to deceive rather than express true propositions. But if this is true, then why do we not consider that fiction is intended to deceive? Why does fiction have semantic properties such as truth whereas fake news does not? Currie (1990)",
