Among the first class of beasts, those which are notable for their abilities to deceive, there are three kinds of deception: these are noted by the camouflages of the chameleon, accurate imitations of the manticore, and the “seductive skills of sirens”. While we might think this to be a medieval taxonomy of epistemic harms only, the kinds of epistemic harms the medievalists worried about are not far off from contemporary epistemic harms and risks; misinformation, false and inauthentic narratives, and bullshit.",

    "text": "According to reductionism in personal identity, personal constitution, what defines the persistence of the human person over time, is reducible to psychological states being bound together. Causlism is the most popular account that explains the constitution of these psychological states. Accordingly to the causalist account, an object A at time T\\(_1\\) is identical to object B at time T\\(_2\\) as long as we can draw a continuous line from object A at time T\\(_1\\) to object B at time T\\(_2\\).\nNarrativists have argued that such accounts undermine our concepts of agency and moral responsibility, failing to explain attributions of praise or blame in response to an agent’s actions. This is because they offer no way to define the line as beginning at T\\(_1\\) and ending at T\\(_2\\). Christine (kors89?) proposes a practical conception of narrative identity. Accordingly, an agent is a person who uses narrative to define their own constitution. She calls this the self-constitution model of personal identity.",

As such, while the utilitarian asks ’what should be done for them?’, the Kantian asks ‘what ought they do?’.
