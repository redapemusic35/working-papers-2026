### The Manticore in Medieval Art

We might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by @gilm20, art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption [132]. Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodox ends intending to motivate desirable behaviors and behavioral responses. On one account of this deception, a person holds false beliefs about themselves. These beliefs stem from hermeneutically unjust environments where the individual lacks access to resources that would lead to accurate self-understanding and moral beliefs. Such beliefs are rooted in irrational actions performed by the individual.

It does this by contrasting the concept of hermeneutic justice as popularized by Miranda Fricker (2007) but developed by earlier feminists. We might think that medieval art has no place in a discussion about epistemic injustice, but I argue that the depiction of the fictional beast called the manticore, as a personification of deception lends credibility to this claim. According to the modern function of art summed up by Jonathan Gilmore (2020), art’s function is oriented to ends such as pleasure, entertainment, and absorption (Gilmore 2020, 132). Conversely, the medieval function of art is directed at more orthodoxical ends intending to motivate behaviors and behavioral responses. As an artistic object, the Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.

The Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, a human-like face and the tail of a scorpion. Later writers would quote Ctesias’ description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king’s court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.
