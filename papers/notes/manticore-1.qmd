# Pinero: Aesthetics of Evil in Middle Ages: Beasts as Symbol of the Devil

The Manticore is a fictionalized beast that was born in Persian art and literature sometime around its cultural zenith. It at once symbolizes evil, death and hell, but in medieval religious art, it came to symbolize the power of Christ over death and hell.

The Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, a human-like face and the tail of a scorpion. Later writers would quote Ctesias’ description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king’s court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.

On some accounts, the manticore is a union between a hyena and Ethiopian lioness. It imitates the voices of men and possesses a fixed and immoveable gaze. In addition, it does not possess gums in either of its jaws, and rather than having multiple teeth, it has one large one.

Ctesias argued that the Manticore had a triple row of teeth which fit into each other like a comb, the face and ears of a human, blood colored eyes, the body of a lion and a stinging tail similar to a scorpion. While Pliny the elder argued that it imitated the voices of men, Ctesias tells us that its voice resembles a union of a flute and trumpet, that it is exceedingly swift, and has an appetite for human flesh [p. 280].

Aristotle questions Ctesias' account, but nevertheless preserves it in his own writings. He gives Ctesias' account, that the Manticore possesses a double row of teeth, similar feet and size of a lion, with ears and face like a man. Grey colored eyes and a red body, with a tail like that of a scorpion. [p. 30-31; also see Aristotle, History of Animals 8.28, 605b22-606a10]

Owing to the fantastical nature of these accounts, it is highly probable that they are either misguided or motivated by some purposes other than truth. In the 57th question of the 1st of the second part of the Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas defends the view of art as a form of right reason. There is a distinction here between the right reason for making objects, and the right reason for doing good actions. We should first focus on the point that is important to both of these activities, is the right use of one’s cognitive faculties. The difference lies in the produced object, whether an action or thing.
