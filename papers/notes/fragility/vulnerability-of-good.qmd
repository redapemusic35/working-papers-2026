### The vulnerability of the Good Human Life

All human excellence requires external resources and necessary conditions.

* External objects to exercise virtues towards
* External objects to receive our virtues

The most important of these require relational virtues.

E.g.,

* Good activities of citizenship
* Political attachment
* Personal love
* Friendship

#### The Relational Harm of Slavery

Good character requires civic activity, good political surroundings.

A slave however, lacks:

* choice
* *philia*

A person needs to be able to make free and un-coerced choices. A slave is unable to do so since he belongs to someone else who makes choices for him. Owing to his inability to make free and unconstrained choices, a slave is unable to use their capacity for practical reason, choosing objects for their own sake. As such, they cannot share in *philia* which "is based on mutual respect for choice and character" [348].
