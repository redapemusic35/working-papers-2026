# Patricia Collins Black Feminist Thought

::: {#collins-knowledge-power}

In the 2009 version of Collin's Black Feminist Thought, BFT, Collins draws greater emphasis between relationships of knowledge and power. It is often said

* that knowledge = power,

but a worrying theme throughout the book, is that this is wrong and

* rather power = knowledge.

One might notice the misapplication of a logical principle here, because whenever we use the equals sign, there is not a logical difference between power = knowledge and knowledge = power.

> Rather, this says that power is identical in value to knowledge and if power is identical to knowledge, then knowledge is identical to power.

In other words, the concern would be that the direction of fit is not directional rather than uni- or bi-directional.

Does:

* knowledge $\rightarrow$ power

or

* power $\rightarrow$ knowledge

or

* knowledge $\leftrightarrow$ power

or

* power $\leftrightarrow$ knowledge

right more true?

Knowledge $\rightarrow$ power means that if one has knowledge, then they have power or that if power $\rightarrow$ knowledge, then assuming they have power, then they have knowledge. Instead of thinking that if one has knowledge, then they have power, using the equals sign says that one's having knowledge is identical to them having power and that one having power is identical to having knowledge.

This is a common position in what is lauded as "African American Studies". Often times these positions are wrapped in the language of "struggle". While Collins notes that this "struggle" is a struggle for empowerment, it is not particularly clear who the struggle is directed at. She argues that the struggle is global and transcendent, she defines the struggle as one for "survival." But she expands the target in this edition to include recent developments of sexuality and "sexual politics" of black womanhood.

The problem with the above however, is that any correlation between knowledge and power is wrong from a Christian world view. Rather one is grounded in power if they have humility. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." Here, the implication is not on knowledge, knowledge without wisdom is useless and a fool's errand, it does not lead to "empowerment". Collins mentions the 19th century black feminist scholar Maria Stewart, noting that she urged self-reliance and independence and that her work was suppressed along with many other black feminist scholars of the era. However, we as a society know a lot more about the importance of community and inter-personal relationships, a fact which Stewart herself draws attention to:

> You have souls committed to your charge. . . . It is you that must create in the minds of your little girls and boys a thirst for knowledge, the love of virtue, . . . and the cultivation of a pure heart.

If there is an adversarial correlation between dominant social classes and the suppression of black knowledge work, then it would be difficult to explain Collin's publications assuming that there is a direct benefit to less-dominant social classes.
