## Two Classes of Evil in Medieval Bestiaries {background-color="#e1d5e7"}

- **Deceivers**: Camouflage, imitation, seduction
  - Chameleon: camouflage
  - Manticore: accurate imitations
  - Sirens: seductive skills
- **Fear and Death Generators**
- Purpose: Educate illiterate via art for **orthodoxy** and proper behavior (Piñero Moral 2021)

Medieval taxonomy mirrors modern epistemic harms: misinformation, false narratives, bullshit.

## Deception in Bestiaries → Modern Epistemic Harms

- Medieval worries: Not just epistemic, but close to today
  - **Misinformation** (chameleon-like camouflage)
  - **False/inauthentic narratives** (manticore imitation)
  - **Bullshit** (siren seduction)

> Beasts symbolize **evil** to promote right action.

---

## Hermeneutic Injustice (Fricker 2007)

- **Definition**: Gap in collective interpretive resources
  - Hinders making sense of one's own experiences
- **Link to Deceptive Evil**
  - Restricts hermeneutic participation in social life
  - Historically against women, but not exclusively
- **Manticore** as artistic representation of this evil

> Evil is "direct and intuitive by the victim" (Russell 2016, 1).

Hermeneutic injustice deceives like the manticore.

## Hermeneutic Codes in Bestiaries {background-image="url(path/to/beast-image.jpg)" background-opacity="0.2"}

> Beastiaries composed of **hermeneutic codes** mapped to levels: anatomy → ethical-philosophical → moral → theological (Voisenet 2020, 321–25). Words and images intertwined (Kay 2017).

## Types of Codes

| Level              | Focus                  |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Mere Anatomy       | Physical description   |
| Ethical-Philosophical | Moral reasoning     |
| Moral Perspectives | Behavior norms         |
| Theological        | God vs. Devil          |

## Art and Complex Reality

> "Commitment with reality undeniable, yet so complex... limits blurred between what **is** and **is not**, what we **believe** and **know**..." (Cronin 1941).

- **Conflict**: God vs. Devil
  - Jesus' death/resurrection: Devil's action → God's victory
- Art configures **human condition**: experience, knowledge, beliefs

---

Medieval *ars* > mere norms; profound lecture on reality.

## Origins of the Manticore

- **Persian literature** (5th–4th BC, Ctesias)
  - Red skin, lion-sized, **human-like face**, 3 rows of teeth, **scorpion tail**
  - Eats men; imitates voices (Pliny)
- **Evolution**:

---

| Source     | Key Traits                     |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Aristotle | Rough as lion, grey eyes, sting darts spines |
| Pliny     | Fixed gaze, continuous teeth, imitates speech |
| Ctesias   | Azure eyes, blood color, flute/trumpet voice |

> Became symbol of **evil, death, hell** → Christ's power over them.

---

## Familiar vs. Unfamiliar Imagery

- **Familiar**: Animals (lion, scorpion)
- **Unfamiliar**: Human face, triple teeth → **Immaterial evil**
- **Why?** Easier to intuit abstract concepts: pain, death, good vs. evil
- **Hermeneutic Tool**: Confront evil's attributes (seduces, deceives, harms)

## Emotions, Cognition, and Identity {background-color="#f7f7f7"}

**Gut Reactions (Prinz)**: Emotions affect cognition

| Emotion Type | Cognitive Effect |
|--------------|------------------|
| Positive    | Stereotypes, creative reasoning (Isen et al. 1987) |
| Negative    | Narrow focus, threats (Ohman et al. 2001) |
| Congruent   | Better recall (Bower 1981) |

---

- **Identity Links**:
  - Narrative Identity
  - Personal Identity (response to emotions)

::: {.notes}
Emotions shape self-understanding.

## Black Authenticity & Controlling Images (Laybourn 2018)

- **Criticism**: Identity commodified as "realness"
  - Authentic? Male, female, ethnic...
- **Hermeneutic Injustice**:
  - Popular media images accepted as representative
  - Blurs harm vs. authenticity
- **Core Question**: Narratives → Personal Identity?
  > "We are defined by stories we accept about ourselves" (controversial).

---

## Wicked: Modern Analogy for Othering

- **Elphaba** (Cynthia Erivo): Green skin → scapegoat
  - Leans into "wicked" persona
- **Trope**: Water bucket (racist bathing myth)
- **Outcome**: "Dies" (hides), flees as eternal outsider with Fiyero
- **Link**: Hermeneutic gap → false self-beliefs

> Medieval manticore **lends credibility** to epistemic injustice claims.

## Medieval vs. Modern Art Functions

| Aspect          | Medieval                  | Modern (Gilmore 2020)     |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Orthodoxy, behavior motivation | Pleasure, entertainment |
| **Outcome**    | Desirable actions/dispositions | Absorption, revenue     |
| **Example**    | Manticore → intuit evil  | Advertising campaigns    |

---

- **Medieval**: "Right reason" (Aquinas, Summa Theologica I-II, Q.57)
- Good cognitive use → virtuous actions/objects

::: {.notes}
Gaskell's *Mary Barton* → social safety net (Harrison 2011).
:::

## Moral Reality in Medieval Art (Piñero Moral 2021)

> Art represents **complex reality**, esp. moral (De Bruyne 1959).

- **Manticore**: Evil via projection (obscure/contested reality)
- **Not** mere facts/history → **wished beliefs** for orthodoxy
- **Key**: Motivate behavior for good outcomes

**Conclusion**: Bestiaries combat **deceptive evil** like hermeneutic injustice.
